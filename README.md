# ETL-PROJECT
The project focuses on building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to consolidate sales data from multiple sources (CSV files, SQL databases, and APIs) into a centralized data warehouse for analytics and reporting. The main goal is to provide the retail business with insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior.
